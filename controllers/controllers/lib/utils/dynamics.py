    """
    Vectorized dynamic propagation for a batch of state-action pairs.
    
    Instead of propagating each state with all possible actions,
    this function assumes that for each state in the batch a corresponding 
    action is provided. Thus, the function computes one propagated state 
    per input state-action pair.
    
    Args:
        states (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (batch_size, 3) representing
            the current states, where each state is [x, y, theta].
        actions (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (batch_size,) or (batch_size,1)
            representing the steering angle for each corresponding state.
        dt (float): Time step for propagation.
        v (float): Velocity, assumed constant across the batch.
        wheelbase (float): Vehicle wheelbase (distance between axles).
        
    Returns:
        next_states (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (batch_size, 3) containing
            the propagated states for each state-action pair.
